Usage
-----

You dont need to do anything. Once it's installed,
``zsh-you-should-use`` will let you know if you wrote a command with an
existing alias.

``you-should-use`` also detects global aliases:

and Git aliases:

Requirements
------------

``you-should-use`` officially supports zsh versions larger than 5.1.

It is possible the plugin might work on even older versions.
However they would not have been tested as part of the CI test process.

Installation
------------

Add one of the following to your ``.zshrc`` file depending on your
package manager:

ZPlug_

::

    zplug "MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use"

Antigen_

::

    antigen bundle "MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use"

Zgen_

::

    zgen load "MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use"

oh-my-zsh_

Copy this repository to ``$ZSH/custom/plugins``, where ``$ZSH`` is the
root directory of oh-my-zsh:

::

    git clone https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use.git $ZSH/custom/plugins/you-should-use


Then add this line to your ``.zshrc``

::

    plugins=(you-should-use $plugins)

`Arch Linux`_

Install the ``zsh-you-should-use`` (AUR_) package::

    yaourt -S zsh-you-should-use

Then add this line to your ``.zshrc``::

    source /usr/share/zsh/plugins/zsh-you-should-use/you-should-use.plugin.zsh

Displaying Results
------------------

By default, ``you-should-use`` will display the best match from any
matching aliases found. However, you can change this behaviour so that
it displays *all* matches found by setting the value of ``YSU_MODE``.

-  To only display best match (default): ``export YSU_MODE=BESTMATCH``
-  To display all matches: ``export YSU_MODE=ALL``


Customising Messages
--------------------

By default, the following message is displayed in bold when an alias is found:

::

    Found existing %alias_type for "%command". You should use: "%alias"

Where the following variables represent:

* ``%alias_type`` - the type of alias detected (alias, git alias, global alias)
* ``%command`` - the command that was typed by the user
* ``%alias`` - the matching alias that was found

This default message can be customised by setting the ``YSU_MESSAGE_FORMAT`` environment variable.

If for example, you wish to display your own custom message in red, you can add the
following to your ``~/.zshrc``:

::

    export YSU_MESSAGE_FORMAT="\e[31mHey! I found this %alias_type for %command: %alias\e[0m"

``\e[31m`` is the escape code in terminals to use red foreground text. ``\e[0m`` sets
the text back to a normal color.

You can read more about how you can use terminal escape codes here:
http://wiki.bash-hackers.org/scripting/terminalcodes

Hardcore Mode
-------------

**For the brave and adventerous only** :godmode:

You can enable Hardcore mode to enforce the use of aliases. Enabling
this will cause zsh to refuse to execute commands you have entered if an
alternative alias for it exists. This is a handy way of forcing you to
use your aliases and help you turn those aliases into muscle memory.

Enable hardcore mode by setting the variable ``YSU_HARDCORE`` to 1.

::

    export YSU_HARDCORE=1

Now if you type a command that has an alias defined and you didnt use
it, zsh will refuse to execute that command:

::

    $ export YSU_HARDCORE=1
    $ ls -lh
    Found existing alias for "ls -lh". You should use: "ll"
    You Should Use hardcore mode enabled. Use your aliases!

Contributing

Pull requests and Feedback are welcome! :tada:

I have tried to cater for as many use cases that I can think of.
However, they are naturally tailored to to my own workflow and I could
be missing many others.

Because of this if there is a specific use case that does not work as
you would expect or if you have any suggestions to how the plugin should
behave, feel free to `open an
issue <https://github.com/MichaelAquilina/zsh-you-should-use/issues/new>`__

Running Tests
-------------

Install `zunit <https://zunit.xyz/>`__. Run ``zunit`` in the root
directory of the repo.

::

    $ zunit
    Launching ZUnit
    ZUnit: 0.8.2
    ZSH:   zsh 5.3.1 (x86_64-suse-linux-gnu)

    ✔ ysu message correct output
    ✔ ysu global message correct output
    ✔ ysu git message correct output

NOTE: It is required that you use a minimum zunit version of 0.8.2

NOTE: The tests that run move your git configuration to a temporary
location during the test process so that your user configuration does
not interfere with tests. This will be restored at the end of each test
so there is no risk in losing your settings. If for some strange reason
zunit crashes or does not restore your git configuration automatically,
all you need to do is run ``mv ~/.gitconfig.bak ~/.gitconfig``
